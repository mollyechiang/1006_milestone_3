Data and Code Related to "Education and Voting Conservative: Evidence from
a Major Schooling Reform in Great Britain"

This project is for my Gov1006 class at Harvard University.

This project includes data and code related to Marshall J. REducation and Voting Conservative: Evidence from a Major Schooling Reform in Great Britain. University of Chicago Press 2016;378:866-7. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMc1712773. link

Marshall investigates the effect of the 1947 shool leaving age reform in Great Britian on political preferences later in life (particularly in probability to vote for the Conservative Party). Voting data from 10 elections (between 1947 and 2010) was compared between individuals who were too old to have experienced the reform and those which were effected by the reform, which lead to a huge increase in years spent in high school nationwide.
